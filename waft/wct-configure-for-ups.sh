Configure WCT source for building against a UPS products.

  wct-configure-for-ups.sh install_directory

This assumes the UPS environment for the dependent products is
already "setup".  

If install_directory is outside of UPS control then you can stop
reading now.

If the install_directory is the string "ups" then the source will be
configured to install into $WIRECELL_FQ_DIR.

That may point to a pre-existing "wirecell" UPS product.  If it does,
reusing it will install files on top of any pre-exising ones without
check so be careful.  

To make a fresh "wirecell" UPS produce area one can "declare" it like:

  $ ups declare wirecell <version> \
       -f \$(ups flavor) \
       -q e14:prof \
       -r wirecell/<version> \
       -z /path/to/install/products \
       -U ups  \
       -m wirecell.table

You'll have to provide the wirecell.table yourself, likely by copying
it from an existing "wirecell" UPS product.

Then, the calling environment can be munged like:

  $ setup wirecell <version> -q e14:prof

UPS is such a great and simple system! /s
